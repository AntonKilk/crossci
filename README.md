# CROSSCI Learning Platform MVP

This is a proof of concept built during EdTech Tallinn hackaton. The idea of the project is to use generative AI model to divide complex STEM studies projects into smaller chunks of exersises. AI model should be helpful in explaining difficult parts of STEM projects. Web page is hosted here:  [Crossci](https://crossci.netlify.app/)

It combines teachers page and students page.
- As a teacher I want to see my course students progress.
- As a teacher I want to see set of projects available grouped by difficulty
- As a student I want to use AI chat to get help in project explanation
